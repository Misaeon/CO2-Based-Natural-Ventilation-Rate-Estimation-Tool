# NVAPF: CO2-Based-Natural-Ventilation-Rate-Estimation-Tool
The software was developed in conjunction with a research paper entitled "**NVAPF: An adaptive particle filter algorithm for CO2-based natural ventilation rate estimation with high temporal resolution and stability**" published in Building and Environment.

This software estimates the **Natural ventilation rate** based on a proposed **Adaptive particle filter** using the **CO2 tracer gas** method, which takes into account the **CO2 measurement uncertainty** and **Natural ventilation dynamics**. The software is capable of estimating and computing the ventilation rate by both the **Transient mass balance model** and **Adaptive particle filter**, based on the measurement data saved in CSV files.
